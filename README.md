### GBM-SDE:

In this Jupyter notebook, I utilized the Monte Carlo method to simulate Bitcoin data over a 2-year period using Geometric Brownian motion.

### Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process:

In this Jupyter notebook, I used the Monte Carlo method to simulate Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process to reproduce the intutive Wikipedia plot for 4 O-U process.

### Kramers−Moyal coefficients:

In this Jupyter notebook, we demonstrate how to find and visualize the Kramers-Moyal coefficients for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. 

### Random walk:
I learned this from Griffin Chure's Tutorial, Simulating Random Walks licensed under an MIT license.

### ARIMA-co2-dataset:
I applied ARIMA modeling to the CO2 dataset to forecast future values, following the steps outlined in the DigitalOcean tutorial on time series forecasting with ARIMA. Using the tutorial, I iteratively tested various parameter combinations to identify the model with the lowest AIC, ensuring the best fit for the data.
